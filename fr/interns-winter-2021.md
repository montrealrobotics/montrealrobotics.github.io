Upto two internships are available at the **Robotics and Embodied AI Lab (REAL)** at Universite de Montreal and **Mila**. Internship roles are full-time (**40 hrs/week**) with the possibility of remote work. Preferred duration: **Jan - May 2021**.

**Note**: Students at undergraduate and graduate levels are welcome to apply too

Selected interns will leverage end-to-end differentiable SLAM frameworks (such as [gradslam](https://gradslam.github.io)) to implement deep learning solutions for 3D perception, navigation, and manipulation. They will have the opportunity to collaborate with the vibrant research community at Mila and publish at leading robotics/vision/ML venues. Candidates will be compensated competitive to graduate student salaries in the Montreal area.

**Requirements**:
- Must be available for full-time roles for winter 2021 (Jan-May 2021)
- Experience in one or more of the following: 3D reconstruction/mapping, deep learning for 3D perception, deep reinforcement learning, SLAM
- Strong programming skills (prior pytorch experience required)

**Desired**:
- Experience with one of differentiable computer vision (see [Kornia](https://github.com/kornia)), differentiable rendering, or with designing and implementing RL environments and agents
- Prior publication record at robotics/vision/ML venues
- Prior open-source project contributions/management

**How to apply**: Please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/FFQXiwu44K6n9su3A).
